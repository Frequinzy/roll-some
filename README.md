# Roll Some Dice

`roll-some` is a super simple cli for rolling several rows of different types of die

## Future Plans
If I feel like it I might update this at a later point. The things I would like to improve are (in no particular order):

* Update general code structure
* Improve CLI API and add documentation
* Create simple HTMX powered web interface
